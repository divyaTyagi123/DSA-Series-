// in java multiple inheritance is not supported as if same variable is defined in both parents classes
// then child class has no particular way to decide which parent's variable has to be called
// that's why multiple inheritance is not supported in java
// but interface in java can provide multiple inheritance in java

// hybrid inheritance is combination of single and multiple inheritance but not supported by java
